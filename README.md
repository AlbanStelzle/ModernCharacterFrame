#### Features
- Re-skins default Character frame. You can expand/collapse side panel by pressing a button.
- Improved character model frame. You can drag/rotate it more freely than default version.
- **Stats panel.** Expand Character frame to show stats panel. It's fully customizable: you can collapse/expand stat categories, you can change their order.
- **Titles panel.** Works better (and less buggy) than built-in version.
- **Equipment manager.** Great improvement from default version. Also fixed weird bug with ignored slots which is present even on retail client (ignored slots are being saved correctly now when you create/edit sets).
- **Other addons integration.** You can integrate [TacoTip]'s Gear Score value into Item Level stat line *(check Interface/AddOns/ModernCharacterFrame options)*.
